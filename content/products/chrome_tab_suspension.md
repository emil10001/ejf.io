For those of you who are like me, and typically have 30-50+ tabs open in Chrome at a time, [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?utm_source=plus) might be a very useful extension for you. It allows you to suspend tabs to be reloaded when you actually visit them again.

I get into a lot of situations where I'll have a browser window dedicated to researching a specific topic, or poking around the docs of a project, or whatever. When I switch tasks to do other things, I like to keep those sessions around, but don't necessarily want them in memory. This helps with that, to drastically reduce the amount of RAM that Chrome needs to run. I went from being nearly pegged at 14-15GB down to 10GB just by suspending a couple windows' worth of tabs.

I also use TabCloud for saving off windows of tabs when I think that I'm pretty much done with something, but may want to come back later.ï»¿

There was an announcement last week that [Chrome may be getting this functionality built-in](https://codereview.chromium.org/1249693002). I'm certainly looking forward to a release of Chrome that won't require an extension to get this feature! Until then, The Great Suspender works reasonably well.
