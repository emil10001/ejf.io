}Going back to CDs
=================

<p>After more than a decade of getting my music almost exclusively via digital distribution channels (yes, legal ones), I&rsquo;ve decided to go back to CDs. I started a project of ripping all of my CDs into several formats, mp3s for the car, Apple Lossless for listening on my Macs, and FLAC for my phone. I have a DAC, and decent headphones, and I&rsquo;ve started to be able to hear the difference in quality between streaming music, and lossless stuff that I have locally.</p>

<p>It has been a very interesting experience so far, going back and listening to albums that I haven&rsquo;t listened to in years, and hearing new bits and pieces that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. Re-listening to some of my all-time favorite albums, like &ldquo;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&rdquo;, has been really fantastic. I heard a vocal track on Cake&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Distance&rdquo; that I had never really heard before, and that was one of my favorite songs at one point.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve also lost a lot of my favorite albums over the years, to and from college, moving across the country a couple of times, and generally not using them. I&rsquo;m going through slowly and ripping what I have, and collecting things that I&rsquo;ve never owned, new stuff, and back-filling things that I lost. Doing it this way also encourages me to really listen to what I&rsquo;ve got playing, and I&rsquo;m finding that just doing that, I&rsquo;m enjoying music more than I have in a long time.ï»¿</p>
