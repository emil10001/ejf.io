}Giveaway - Raspberry Pi
=======================

<p>I&rsquo;m giving away my Raspberry Pi. I haven&rsquo;t used the thing in months, and I&rsquo;m trying to get rid of all of the things that I have that fall into that category. I would sell it, but it&rsquo;s simply not worth enough to justify the effort. So, instead, I thought that I might try something a little different.  Post a comment on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ng5zm/im_giving_away_a_raspberry_pi_if_you_want_it_tell/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, telling me why I should give you this RPi. The highest scoring entry will win the device. I&rsquo;ll even pay for shipping.</p>

<p>The device will come with a power supply, and a blank 8GB SD card.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&rsquo;ll run this for 24 hours, so it&rsquo;ll end tomorrow, October 1, 2013 at 10am PT.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>Redditor Jawshee_pdx has won, with 160 upvotes for the following entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jawshee_pdx: My youngest daughter is showing a greater and greater interest in computers and technology. I&rsquo;d like to get her a raspberry pi to hopefully foster strong STEM learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve shipped out the device, and hopefully Jawshee_pdx will confirm at some point that they received it.</p>

<h2>UPDATE 2:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1o04wd/pi_received_thank_you_emil10001/" target="_blank">Jawshee_pdx confirmed that he received the RPi.</a> Hope he and his daughter enjoy it!</p>
