For anyone who's curious about startups, there is an excellent podcast series called ["How to Start A Startup"](http://www.howtostartastartup.co/) (first episode in video form is the above video). It's a Stanford class, run by Y Combinator (the premier startup accelerator, of which TiKL is an alum), and it goes through just about every conceivable aspect of how to start a startup.

While all of the content applies to the specific type of company that startups are, there are really excellent episodes on all sorts of things that people with different interests, and roles will find useful. From managing, to getting a new company off the ground, to figuring out how to build a product that people are going to love. ï»¿
