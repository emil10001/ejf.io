Google Dev Social principles

Social media is about reaching people with a message that they want to engage with and **inspiring them to take action**.

* Building awareness about a new product or feature
* Broad inspiration
* Training

It's about being in conversation with your audience in a way that's meaningful to them by **both talking and listening**.

Respond to comments.

And, it's about **creating community** for your audience, connecting them through common interests.

Questions to ask:

* Is this engaging?
* Is there a call to action?
* Will this foster and facilitate conversations?

Things learned along the way

* Move fast
* Fail
* Iterate

Channel specific learnings

* G+
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Blogs

Other general learnings

* Posting scheduling and consistency
* Comment/reply management
* Re-sharing/influencer engagement

Think about the split between native on the platform and off behind a link. Images and videos may work much better natively.

## G+

**Targeted & Technical**

* Long-form content including small code snippets
* Video embed
* Photos, GIFs, albums

Think about how your links will populate on G+.

* Does the image get pulled through?
* If it looks good, then use it
* If it doesn't, maybe use a photo, and add link in the post

## Twitter

**Quick & engaging**

* GIFs to drive brand awareness or accompanied by a link to more Content
* Photos or memes
* Live blogging
* YouTube links no longer populate a video
* Use a GIF of the video
* Make sure to have room in the tweet for an image and link

## Pulling Twitter and G+ together

Using Twitter to promote long-form content in G+ is a great way to engage people on both platforms.

## Facebook

**Potential growth... with investment**

* Native video upload
* Incremental reach

Pay-to-play, need to spend money to get views. Native uploads are more engaging on Facebook.

**Organic growth on Facebook**

Video & call to action (ask to like the page) will help to grow organically.

## Blogs

* Primary outlet for program/product announcements
* Corporate voice, as opposed to an individual opinion forum

Good for in-depth content, maybe less personal, whereas the social platforms may be better for a more personal, conversational.

## Medium

* Forum for a more opinionated, personalized voice: ability to pull in DA's Content
* Emerging space for written long-form content

More personal, and conversational, while still allowing for long-form in-depth content.

### *"If you are persistent, you will get it. If you are consistent, you will keep it."*

## Engagement

Comments are great... except when they're not.

**Do** engage with feedback, positive and negative, to encourage conversation.
**Don't** engage with comments where you can't add value.

We're all in this together. **Reshare other people's content**, but do it in moderation.

## Tracking and measuring

Tracking and measuring on social is throwing spaghetti at the wall.

* Outline objectives up front
* Identify potential data points to prove impact
* Think of ways to make the data meaningful (Q/Q growth)

Know your audience. Pay attention to what they're engaging with and do more of it. If you're really unsure, ask. This is where tracking can come in handy to help growth.

Social media is not just about reach. It's about thoughtfully engaging.

Funnel:

* **Reach** - how many people saw our content?
  * followers
  * impressions
  * page views
  * modeled reach
* **Engagement** - how many people interacted with the content?
  * types of engagements
  * engagement rates
* **Sentiment** - did the content have positive brand impact? *May not really be part of the funnel, since it's so hard to measure.*
  * positive
  * negative
  * neutral
* **Conversions** - SDK downloads docs visits
  * GA - referrers
