}Verizon Support Call Quality
============================




<p>Why is the call quality of Verizon&rsquo;s support so terrible? They are supposed to be a telecom company, which is usually supposed to mean that they&rsquo;re going to be responsible for handling all of your calls. So, why is the quality of their support lines so poor? I&rsquo;m not talking the service that the reps give, that&rsquo;s a whole other story.</p>

<p>It seems like if you have a call with perfect clarity, it should be to the mothership. Instead, it sounds like the representatives are hanging out at the beach, talking amongst themselves (I can actually hear several other people&rsquo;s conversations).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since moved off of Verizon to T-Mobile, and luckily have not needed to call their customer service yet. And, even luckier, <a href="http://goo.gl/vPIMGK" target="_blank">Talkray&rsquo;s call quality is consistently very good</a>.</p>
