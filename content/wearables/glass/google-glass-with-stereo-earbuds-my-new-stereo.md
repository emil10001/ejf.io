}Google Glass with stereo earbuds. My new stereo earbuds came in today, and I&rsquo;m pretty excited about them.

The stereo earbuds are the single biggest improvement I’ve seen in Glass
so far. The bone conduction speaker was interesting, but inaudible in
most normal situations. This is going to allow me to actually use Glass
for several different things that while possible, was impractical
before, like using it as a headset for calling, listening to music and
being able to actually hear directions.﻿

One missing feature is a2dp. I would love to see support for the
bluetooth a2dp client profile on Glass. There are a lot of apps on
phones that I use, like Audible, that do not have Glassware yet, and
will likely take a while getting there. It would be nice to be able to
use Glass with my new stereo earbuds to listen to any audio coming from
my phone.

If I could do this, I could actually use my new Glass earbuds on my
daily bike commute, but as it is, I still need to use the wired earbuds,
since I listen to Audible books on my ride. I saw at least one other
Explorer asking for this on G+.

In terms of comfort, I’ve worn them for about an hour and a half so far,
listening to music, and had to give them a rest. They aren’t terribly
comfortable, so I’m hoping that the tips are easily replaceable.
