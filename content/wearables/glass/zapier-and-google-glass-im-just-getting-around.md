}Zapier and Google Glass

I&rsquo;m just getting around to checking out Zapier&rsquo;s Glass support, and it is more compelling than I expected. While it would be nice if there were simply more apps available for Glass, Zapier sort of fills in the gaps, and allows you to do some interesting things. For one thing, I can now get notified on my two other gmail accounts on Glass. Since I use my work email way more than my personal, this is going to be a very useful feature. I&rsquo;ve also got it set up to allow me to share photos to Dropbox, which is nice, my phone does this automatically, but until now, if I wanted a photo from Glass on Dropbox, I would have needed to download the photo on my laptop, and upload it to Dropbox manually. I am trying out the Trello integration as well, since my wife and I use that for the grocery list, though I&rsquo;m not sure how useful that one will be for me.

The interesting thing about this is that it greatly extends what you can do with Glass, for very little effort. It does feel like more of a temporary solution, as opposed to a long-term one, where the long-term solution would be these services rolling out their own Glass support, and Glass supporting multiple Gmail accounts (which I&rsquo;m sure it will at some point). For the time being, I&rsquo;m quite happy to have Zapier available.
