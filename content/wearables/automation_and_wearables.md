I've been thinking a lot about automation recently. One of the big questions that I ask myself over and over is, what can I stop spending so much time on? What are things that I'm not great at that could get better through automation?

I have a list of general things that I think would be fun to try automating (which I'll write about later), but of the list of tools, I think that wearables present an interesting opportunity for automation. The problem is, that I am having trouble thinking of what I could do there.

So, I figured that I would ask what people think about this? I'm sure that there are lots of people out there with Glass or Android Wear who dreamed of what they could do with those devices. If those dreams involved automating something, what were they?ï»¿
