}Moto X announcement 
====================




<p>I&rsquo;m quite disappointed by the Moto X announcement. It&rsquo;s a well designed phone, battery life should be spectacular, and they got rid of some of the terrible themed junk that they put on their Droids, but it falls down on a few major points.</p>

<ul><li>Running 4.2.2, not 4.3 - how am I going to use BLE?</li>
<li>To be priced as a high-end phone, even though it&rsquo;s not really</li>
<li>Sold on contract, as opposed to unlocked, sold outright</li>
<li>Launching with a dated version of Android, and updates will need to be approved by carriers</li>
<li>Google Play Edition missing at launch </li>
</ul><p>I really don&rsquo;t want to buy another phone that ties me to a particular carrier (and phone) for another two years, when it&rsquo;s likely that the phone won&rsquo;t provide me with a good experience for more than one year. It seems unlikely that the Google Play Edition, when launched, will support Verizon. I don&rsquo;t care as much about the Google Play Edition as I do about the fact that the carriers have to approve updates. Verizon is just plain awful at that; it&rsquo;s a big reason why I&rsquo;m running CyanogenMod on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus.</p>

<p>The customizations and optimizations look cool, but I&rsquo;ll be holding out for the next Nexus phone.</p>
