Gradle, please
==============

[Gradle, Please](http://gradleplease.appspot.com/)

Someone posted this awesome tool on
[r/androiddev](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1l497c/gradle_please_find_the_right_dependency_string/)
recently. Looks pretty sweet, Iâ€™ll certainly be using it!

Basically, it helps you find the compile string for a Gradle dependency
that exists in Maven Central.
