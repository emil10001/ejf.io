Last night, Elizabeth and I had gotten home from a Halloween party, and after putting the baby to sleep, realized that we hadn't had dinner. I found some frozen Costco carnitas meat in the freezer, and put it together with some corn taco shells. I quickly fried them up and topped them off with salsa and guacamole.
