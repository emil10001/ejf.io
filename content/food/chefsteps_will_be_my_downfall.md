Once in a while, at night, when I don't feel like going to bed, I start watching YouTube videos on my Android TV. I really like watching YouTube on Android TV because it keeps auto-playing videos that are related, and I can basically just let it run without interference and watch stuff that I enjoy. Lately, it's been a lot of [Billy on the Street](https://www.youtube.com/user/billyonthestreettv), which Elizabeth has gotten into as well.

One thing tends to creep up and hook me, and it's the ChefSteps videos. I started checking out their stuff when I bought the immersion cooker, as ChefSteps has a focus on sous vide recipes. They also have a lot of other great stuff, and tonight, when I had YouTube on auto-play, the 'Deep-Fry Frenzy' video came on:

Followed by 'Waffle Iron Frenzy':

Now, it's midnight and I want to cook.

Bonus Billy on the Street video:

I should go to bed.
