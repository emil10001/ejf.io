}Sesame Chicken
==============

One of John’s favorite chinese dishes is Sesame Chicken. A while back he
decided to try cooking his own. After much searching and a couple of
failed attempts, he has perfected the dish. It’s less than half the
calories of takeout and the taste is almost identical (if not better!).

\*One tip: Since it’s just the two of us, we save some for leftovers the
next day. If you are going to do this, make sure you put the sauce in a
separate container. Don’t mix it all together, or it won’t stay crispy.
Just pour sauce over the individual servings when you are ready to eat.
Also, the sauce gets thick when refrigerated, so just add a little water
and heat.

Directions:

Prepare the chicken by cutting it up into one inch cubes. Combine the
other ingredients in a mixing bowl to create batter. Coat chicken pieces
in the batter and then deep fry (or fry in wok or frying pan).

In a saucepan, mix together sugar and cornstarch. Stir in chicken broth,
water, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chile paste, and garlic. Bring to
a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer 5
minutes.

Top with: 2 tablespoons raw sesame seeds, 2 green onions (sliced). Best
served with lightly steamed broccoli and rice.
