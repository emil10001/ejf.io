**Directions:**

This dish is easily split into two parts, the hot part and the cold
part. This is a bit of a deviation from the referenced recipe, as that
recipe doesn’t actually suggest cooking the beans. We think it is an
improvement, as we are not really crazy about eating cold beans. Feel
free to skip cooking the beans if you want. The other diversion from the
referenced recipe is that we use black beans instead of white beans.

What I do when preparing this dish is to put everything together for the
hot portion, stick it in a frying pan on the stove and leave it there
until I’m ready for it. This really doesn’t need to do much more than
heat up for a few minutes. Then, once I have set aside the hot
ingredients, I start on the cold. For the hot ingredients, dice up the
chili(s) and place them in the pan with 1 tbsp of Olive Oil. Then, dice
the red onion, placing about a quarter of the onion into the frying pan
and the rest into your mixing bowl for the cold ingredients. Empty a can
of black beans (don’t bother draining it first) into the pan. Stick a
lid on the pan and don’t forget it’s there.

Moving on, you can get started with the cold ingredients. Shred the
carrot and add it to the mixing bowl. Halve the avocado, remove the pit,
then scoop it out of its skin. Add the avocado to the bowl and mash it
up as you stir. Dice the cilantro and add half to the mixing bowl and
half to the pan on the stove. Next, shred the cheese and add it to the
mixing bowl. For the cabbage, feel free to use more or less depending on
how large a head of cabbage you have. I ended up using a bit less than
half a head. Chop up the cabbage, add it to the bowl and mix the
ingredients together.

Go to the stove and heat up the beans and other ingredients. Once you
see that the beans are getting hot enough, mash them down as much as
possible and stir. Let the beans cook for a couple of minutes on the
stove. Once they are done, simply spoon some of the bean mixture onto a
wrap, add some of the cold ingredients onto the wrap, roll it up and
enjoy. We each had two smallish wraps and that filled us up.

**Discussion:**

I recently discovered my love for Avocado. It was one of those things
like brussels sprouts I never thought I would like, but I’m so glad I
do. Another healthy and tasty food. About half of the fat in this dish
is unsaturated (good!) and the other half is saturated from the cheese.
Keep in mind that our version of the recipe makes double the amount that
is listed in the original, mainly because we normally just have one main
dish and no sides. This is a good recipe if you are cooking for 4 or 5,
and want leftovers for lunch, or if you want to use large wraps instead
of tortilla shells like we did. If you wanted to do a side dish, it may
be helpful to look at a food group not fully covered with this meal. You
do get your vegetables, dairy, and whole grains in the wraps. Obviously
this lacks in the meat department, but you still get a good amount of
protein. Maybe a nice fruit salad or a small baked potato would make
this a well balanced meal. Enjoy!
