### A documentary about all the hidden sugar in "healthy" foods

I read [this article in the NY Times](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/what-eating-40-teaspoons-of-sugar-a-day-can-do-to-you) about an upcoming documentary, styled after "Super Size Me", where a guy consumes 40 teaspoons of sugar a day. He does this while eating seemingly healthy foods. Reading that made me thankful for my wife, Elizabeth, who has been bringing this sort of thing to my attention for years, and has helped us to avoid this particular problem.
