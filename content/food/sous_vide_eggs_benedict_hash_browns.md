This morning, I decided to try making eggs eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce, and a side of hash browns. I used the [Chef Steps](http://www.chefsteps.com) [75ºC egg recipe](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/75-c-egg), along with their recipe for [hollandaise sauce](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/hollandaise).

I'll give the short versions below, what's really nice about these two recipes is that they are both cooked at the same temperature, so you can actually cook them at the same time.

## Hollandaise

Ingredients list from Chef Steps:

* 40g Champagne vinegar
* 25g Shallots, minced
* 150g Melted butter, salted
* 85g Egg yolk
* 60g Water
* 20g Lemon juice
* 3g Salt, kosher

Reduce the vinegar with the shallots, and strain out the shallots. Then, combine 20g of the vinegar reduction with the rest of the ingredients in a bag (I used a food scale to get the amounts right), and then use your immersion cooker at 75ºC for 30 minutes.

When it's done, you'll want to cool the ingredients in the bag a bit, by running it under cold water. Then use an immersion blender or food processor to combine the ingredients together. After the food processor, I put the sauce back in the bag it cooked in, and cut a small hole in one corner for dosing it out. 

## Eggs

When the hollandaise has 13 minutes left on the timer, drop 4 eggs into the water bath, and let them cook. When they're done, crack them, strain them with a slotted spoon, and place on top of the muffin.

## Everything Else

The rest of this is pretty straightforward, so I'm not going to spell it out. Though I will say that hollandaise makes for a great topping on crsipy hash browns.

## Lessons Learned

The hollandaise didn't come out perfectly, since I substituted the champagne vinegar and shallot reduction with plain white wine vinegar. I also added a couple extra grams of lemon juice, which was noticeable.

The larger issue, was that I'm not sure whether or not a food processor does the job, and I don't know if an immersion blender would work any better. If you look at the photo, you'll notice that the sauce is not entirely consistent. I'll play around with it and try again sometime soon.
