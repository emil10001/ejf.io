}Creamy Artichoke Pasta
======================

Another vegetable I’ve recently fallen in love with is Artichokes! I
googled for an artichoke pasta recipe and found the perfect one. The
cottage cheese and sour cream combination is wonderful. You can
substitute greek yogurt for the sour cream. The original recipe calls
for butter but it doesn’t need it. We also used 100% whole wheat
farfalle (bowtie) pasta instead of spaghetti. Ours is significantly less
calories and fat. Serve with garlic bread.

While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Place olive oil and liquid from artichoke hearts in skillet. Cut
artichoke hearts into bite-size pieces. When olive oil mixture is hot,
