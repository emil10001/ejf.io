**Directions:**

Combine the sauce ingredients in a food processor. Begin with the
tomatoes, and add the other whole ingredients, blending them as you go.
Once all of the sauce ingredients have been mixed together, set aside.
Chop the onion, bell pepper and chili peppers, place into a frying pan.
Add the cashews to the frying pan, along with the oil. Chop the cilantro
and set it aside. Cube the boneless, skinless chicken breast, add it to
the frying pan and fry until the chicken is cooked. Once the chicken is
cooked, pour in the sauce, and stir it in. Once the sauce is hot, addthe
chopped cilantro. Finally, add in the ½ cup of half and half and stir
until it is evenly distributed. Serve over ½ cup steamed rice.

**Discussion:**

This is a great dish if you have a taste for ethnic foods. We don’t do
many “traditional” meals. Spice it up! John loves to put his own spin on
a recipe and it always turns out delicious. The focus here is great
tasting and healthy. You would be surprised how healthy this is after
tasting it. This dish is a great source of protein and healthy fats. The
Mayo Clinic recommends you get 10 - 35% of your total daily calories
from protein, 20 - 35% from fat, and 45 - 65% from carbs. Of course this
all depends on your lifestyle, whether you are trying to lose fat or
gain muscle. We have been trying to pay close attention to the amounts
of these important nutrients we are getting, and as you can see, you
don’t need to deprive yourself. We complement this with white rice, but
if you want to get your whole grains, brown rice is a better choice.
Another great complement is Naan (Indian flatbread). Make it whole wheat
and you’ve got yourself a delicious and healthy dinner!
