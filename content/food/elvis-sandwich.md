**Directions:**

This is an amazing, yet very simple sandwich. It is literally just bread
(or a bagel), peanut butter, banana slices and bacon. I made mine on a
toasted bagel. Start by toasting the bagel. After itâ€™s toasted, spread
about 3 tablespoons of peanut butter on both halves of the bagel, I
prefer the cruncy kind. Then add one sliced up banana to one half, and a
couple of strips of crispy bacon to the other. Put the two halves
together and consume.
