Tonight, I decided to go with a fairly simple pasta. The noodles are capellini, the cheese is pecorino romano, and it's topped with a home made red sauce.

The sauce was made with:

* canned whole peeled tomatoes
* tomato paste
* fresh garlic
* fresh basil
* ground beef
* shallots
* mushrooms
* olive oil

Here's how I made the sauce:

1. Dice the shallots, a few cloves of garlic, and a few mushrooms, and put them into a pan with some olive oil.
1. Cook until the shallots start to turn clear.
1. Add the ground beef, pulling it apart into small, even chunks, and reduce the heat down to medium.
1. In a food processor, add the 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes, 6oz can of tomato paste, 4 cloves of garlic, a few mushrooms, a bit of olive oil, and the fresh basil.
1. Turn on the food processor, and run until it's the consistency that you want.
1. Once the meat is thoroughly cooked, drain the grease, and add the sauce from the food processor.
1. Cook on medium-low.
