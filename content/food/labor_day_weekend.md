This weekend was an amazing weekend for food at home. I didn't grill at all, but we ate well. I'll share a couple of the meals that I made, one from Friday night, and the other from Monday's dinner. I did make pancakes somewhere in there, but forgot about grabbing a photo.

## Endive Salad

First up was Friday night's dinner, a modified [Warm Radicchio Salad](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/warm-radicchio-salad), with endives instead of radicchio. The salad was topped with a freshly made [chive oil](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/chive-oil).

## Fruit Cumble

I made a [Simple Fruit Crumble](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/simple-fruit-crumble-with-oatmeal-streusel-topping) for dessert on both Friday and Monday. Friday's was berries, Monday's was plums.

I made a [Warm Squash Salad](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/warm-squash-salad) for dinner on Monday, again, using the chive oil.

## Kebabs

Our friends brought us some homemade kebabs to go with Monday's dinner.

## Beet Risotto

The main course on Monday was [Beet Risotto](http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/beet-risotto), which involved [juicing a raw beet](http://www.livestrong.com/article/432539-juice-beet/). Yes, everything in the kitchen was red after that.
