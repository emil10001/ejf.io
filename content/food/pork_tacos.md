Over the weekend, I bought a ton of meat and cooked it all on Sunday. I used the immersion cooker, and froze most of what I had made. From what I didn't freeze, I took one pork chop, popped it in the food processor, and ground it up. I made pork tacos with it, and they were delicious.

It's pretty much just what you see there, pork, seasoned with taco seasoning and a sliced up chili pepper, lettuce, tomato, onion, and green onions. Then, on the side, I heated up some corn and black beans.
