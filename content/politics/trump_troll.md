I've definitely thought that Trump was trolling the GOP for a while, but haven't been able to come up with a coherent story on why. This is one possibility, but I'm not sure that I buy it completely. I really don't think that Trump is a dumb guy, and I don't think that he would be saying this type of stuff if he were sincerely after the presidency. But, as I said, I haven't been able to figure out what he might want to get out of such a massive trolling effort (not that I really understand trolls to begin with).
