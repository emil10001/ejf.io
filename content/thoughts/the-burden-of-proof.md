<p>Shelly Kagan has done a brilliant job of summing up our responsibility when asked to prove that something does not exist:</p>

<p>Do I, as a physicalist who does not believe in the existence of souls, immaterial entities above and beyond the body, do I need to disprove the existence of souls? &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no soul here, no souls there.&rdquo; No. What I need to do is to take a look at each argument that gets offered for the existence of a soul and rebut it&ndash;explain why those arguments are not compelling. I don&rsquo;t need to prove that souls are impossible. I just need to undermine the case for souls. If there&rsquo;s no good reason to believe in souls, that actually constitutes a reason to believe there are no souls.</p>

<p>This has been brought up in atheist discussions many times regarding the existence of God, but I felt that Kagen really put a point on it in the above quote. <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-9#transcript" target="_blank">Source</a>.</p>
