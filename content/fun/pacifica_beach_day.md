Last weekend, it was fairly hot in our area, so we took the opportunity to head to the beach. I was out surfing at Linda Mar in Pacifica at 7am, and a couple hours after returning home, we headed back there for some relaxing.

Lydia had a great time playing. It was a fun and relaxing way to spend a hot day.
