Last night, we were out to a party on Halloween in a neighborhood that really gets into it. Next door, there was a woman who had made an amazing costume. The photo doesn't do it justice, she must have been on stilts, and the dino head moved around. It reminded me of the viking women in Kung Fury riding the dinosaurs. I'm not sure if that's what she was, but either way, it was impressive.
