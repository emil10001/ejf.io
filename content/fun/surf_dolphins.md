I was out surfing before dawn this morning, at 6am, as I usually do on Saturday mornings. The waves were bigger than expected for near low tide, since there was a bit of wind. While I wasn't doing so well at the actual surfing, I did happen to see one sea lion, and several dolphins swimming around. I felt like that made the trip well worth it.
