}A different kind of app
=======================




<p>The Play Store is an interesting thing, it&rsquo;s incredibly cheap to have a developer&rsquo;s account (or two, whoops), there&rsquo;s no review process to get your app approved in the store, so you could literally get something written, published and delivered within a few hours, if you were motivated to do so. Well, I&rsquo;ve had this idea for a couple of months now, that I wanted to try out, sort of an experiment, I wanted to make an app for my wife that would take the place of a greeting card. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feigdev.forelizabeth" target="_blank">So, I did!</a></p>

<p>It would be much more personal than a greeting card, since I&rsquo;d be writing it for her, but it also felt a bit different. One thing about us is that we live across the country from our families. Whenever we&rsquo;re together and there&rsquo;s a birthday, or celebration where greeting cards are exchanged, they are usually passed around for everyone to look at. That&rsquo;s much harder to do when you live ~2,500 miles away. We tend to do our sharing with family on Facebook, greeting cards don&rsquo;t usually make the cut.</p>

<p>A couple of times, for anniversaries or birthdays, I&rsquo;ve made greeting cards for her by hand, but this feels a bit different from that too. There&rsquo;s a lot you can do with the tools that you have at your disposal these days. Sometimes, using them to put a smile on your wife&rsquo;s face is the best thing that you can spend a couple of hours doing.</p>

<p>I wonder if, in the coming years, we&rsquo;ll start seeing more of these types of apps pop up. I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve seen any previously, though I&rsquo;m sure that this is not a unique idea. I&rsquo;m curious to know who else has done a project like this, published something that was more experimental than most other apps, or doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the typical notions of what an app should be.</p>
