Hello to whomever is reading this, you've landed on my new blog. This will be my primary collection of junk on the web. I've never been super happy with having my content live outside of my control, and this effort intends to fix that issue. That basically means that I will be posting here a lot, and share this content out with to other outlets.

This is a work-in-progress. I've already imported three separate blog's worth of content here, and I'm continuing to add the things that I'd like to keep. So, if you find things broken, or a bit off, hopefully I'll get to fixing it.

On a technical note, I've been wanting to try out a static site generator for a while, and landed on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). It's written in GoLang, and was the only tool I tried that worked as advertised out of the box. It also happens to be quite speedy.

That's all for now!
