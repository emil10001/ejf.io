}Crashlytics is awesome!
=======================




<p>I recently started playing with <a href="https://www.crashlytics.com" target="_blank">Crashlytics</a> for an app that I&rsquo;m working on. I needed better crash reporting than what Google Play was giving me. I had used HockeyApp for work, and I really like that service. My initial thought was to go with HA, but as I started looking around, I noticed that Crashlytics offers a free enterprise level service. No down-side to trying it!</p>

<p>I gave it a shot, they do a nice job with Intellij and Gradle integration for their Android SDK, so setting up my project was quite easy. I tested it out, and again, it was very simple and worked well. The reporting that I got back was quite thorough, more than what anybody else that I&rsquo;m aware of gives you. It reports not just the stack trace, but the state of the system at the time of your crash. If you&rsquo;ve ever run into an Android bug, this sort of thing can really come in handy.</p>

<p>But, then I ran into an issue. I had some thing that was acting funny, so I pinged the Crashlytics support. I was pretty sure that it was an Android bug, but hadn&rsquo;t had time to really nail down what the exact problem was. After a short back and forth, I let them know that I&rsquo;d try to dig in a little more when I had time, but that I was busy and it might not be until next week. The following day, I received a long, detailed response, that included Android source code, to explain exactly the condition that I was seeing. I was floored. They had two engineers working on this, figuring out exactly what the problem was, and what to do with it. I don&rsquo;t think that I could imagine a better customer service experience!</p>

<p>As a note, I have no affiliation with Crashlytics outside of trying out their product for a few days. Their CS rep did not ask me to write this. I was so impressed that I wanted other people to know about it.</p>
