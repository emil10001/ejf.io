}Gists in Tumblr
===============




<p>Displaying github gists in tumblr is not as difficult as I have seen it written. All you need to do is copy the regular embed code into your post. A couple of caveats, first, it won&rsquo;t show up in the preview. Second, it seems to work best if you&rsquo;re in markdown mode, instead of text or html. I have a post which uses multiple gists in a single post, so that works fine too.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/emil10001/5085996.js"></script>
