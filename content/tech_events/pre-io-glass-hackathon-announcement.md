}Pre-I/O Glass Hackathon Announcement!
=====================================




<p>Finally, I have enough of the major pieces in place to be able to make a real announcement about this!</p>

<p>The weekend before Google I/O 2014, we are holding a <a href="http://pre-io-glass-hack.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">24 hour hackathon to build Glassware for Education</a>.</p>

<p>Smart Glass and Wearables will be enabling innovation across many industries in the coming years, one such field is Education. Entangled Ventures has a special interest in seeing leaps forward in Education using technologies like Google Glass. Let&rsquo;s see how we can enable teachers and students with Glass!</p>
